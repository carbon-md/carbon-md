## Reading it

- **Ranges everywhere.** The central figure is a point estimate inside a wide honest band. See [Methodology](/methodology/).
- **`(guessed)`** means the model string didn't match a known class — the estimate still counts, with a wider range.
- **Target** = all-time estimated emissions × `contribution_target`.
- **Outstanding** = target − already contributed. The dollar figure is an *assumption* from your portfolio's price band, not a quote.
- **Calls vs tokens** — calls count ledger events; tokens are input + output (cache reads excluded).

## Notes

- `status` is read-only. It never writes to the ledger or contacts the network.
- If it reports nothing, you haven't captured usage yet — see [`sync`](/cli/sync/) or [`ingest`](/cli/ingest/).
- Monthly figures follow calendar months in local time; contributions are prepared monthly by default.
